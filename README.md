# Meetings are Expensive

1. All meetings are optional.

2. A meeting must always have an agenda.

3. Meeting minutes must be taken during a meeting.

4. Any participant may leave at will, if they have addressed their concerns on the agenda.

5. Meeting minutes must always be provided to all relevant parties and attendees.

6. The meetings must follow the agenda order.

7. If discussion has deviated from the agenda, then `sidebar` can be called.

8. Always invite the minimum amount of people.
